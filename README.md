## Observations
1. From Latitude vs. Temperature Plot we can see that there is a strong no linear assocation as espected as the sample of cities are closer to the equator Tempertures are higher. 
2. Latitude vs. Humidity Plot show no relation between these 2 variables as higher percentages humidity are scatter arround the plot in both sides of the the latitudes.
3. Latitude vs. Cloudiness Plot show no linear relation between these 2 varaiables, we can asume that there is a pattern increase in cloudiness every 15 or 20% throughout the Latitudes
4. Latitude vs. Wind Speed Plot shows a concentration of wind speed arround the 0 to 15mph approximately, but no relation with proximity to the equator.
